# Creative SDK Branding 

Thank you for downloading the Creative SDK. You may use the provided assets to highlight your application’s integration with Adobe Creative Cloud.

This page provides guidelines for use of the program’s Adobe trademarks. Consider these guidelines when naming, describing and marketing your application. Please submit all apps and app updates to creativesdk@adobe.com for brand approval.

Use of the badges and icons is governed by Adobe’s trademark guidelines and Terms of Use, and if any use violates the branding terms outlined below, we may request that you modify or cease usage of the assets.

We recommend that these assets feel at home in your app, so you may customize them using size, color and effects to best match the style of your app.

**Things not to do:**
* Please do not include Creative Cloud, Photoshop or anything similar in the name of your app.
* Please do not feature the Creative Cloud connected badge, Creative Cloud icon, Behance icon or Adobe logo larger than your own logo.
* Please do not stretch, redraw, or otherwise alter the shape of the assets,letterforms within the icons, or use a different typeface to replace the 2-letter mnemonic for the icons.

You may use the Creative Cloud connected badge to highlight your app’s integration with Creative Cloud. If you refer to Creative Cloud in connection with your logo, your logo must be larger than the Creative Cloud icon, logo, or badge.

For legibility:

* Use badge should never appear smaller than 30 pixels tall on screen or .25” in print.
* It should be placed on a solid color background.
* You may leave a space equal to half the height of the badge around it so it is separated from other design or text elements.

### In an application store (i.e. Apple’s App Store, Google Play)

You may include the phrase “Creative Cloud connected” but do not infer that there is a partnership with Adobe or that Adobe endorses your app.

### In your application

Your application should always refer to Creative Cloud in its full name, e.g. “save to Creative Cloud” or “Creative Cloud connected” rather than shortening to “CC.”

The Creative Cloud icon, on tile and off-tile:

[Download Creative Cloud logo assets (.svg & .png)](https://aviarystatic.s3.amazonaws.com/creativesdk/branding/assets/CC_logo.zip)

You may use the Creative Cloud icon in your application in several ways:  
1\. As a button that initiates an action with Creative Cloud, such as signing in or saving to Creative Cloud.  
2\. To indicate that a file is stored in Creative Cloud.  
3\. As a button that initiates editing using Creative Cloud technology.  
4\. As a reference to the App Library integration into your product.

You may use the Creative Cloud connected logo and text badge to promote integration with Adobe Creative Cloud within your application. This treatment should be used instead of the version with the border above. This is the only phrase that should be used within your app to indicate that the technology is powered by the Creative Cloud. Do not use create different lock ups that use phrasing such as “Powered by Lightroom”, or “Powered by Photoshop”.

## Creative Cloud Sign in

Creative Cloud sign in is instrumental to the SDK and providing customers access to the Creative Cloud and Photoshop technology.

Creative Cloud sign in is used to enable the following experiences:

1\. Account creation  
Creative Cloud sign-in lets people quickly create a free Creative Cloud account, allowing them to access powerful technology across multiple mobile apps and online services.  
2\. File access and storage  
When users are signed in to the Creative Cloud they can access and save Files stored in their Creative Cloud accounts from anywhere, even outside your app easily.  
3\. Access to creative technology in desktop and mobile apps.  
Many highly retentive apps let people not just use the Photoshop-enabled tools within their apps, but also integrate the Send-to-desktop technology that allows people to keep working and refining the work on their desktop computer.

**The Sign in Button**

The sign in button is a simple way to trigger the Creative Cloud sign in process from your app:

[Download Creative Cloud Sign In badges (.ai)](https://aviarystatic.s3.amazonaws.com/creativesdk/branding/assets/CC_signin.zip)

When asking users to sign in to your app, you may use the phrases “Sign in” or “Sign in with Adobe ID” paired with either the Adobe A logo or the Creative Cloud logo.

Alternately, the phrase “Sign in to Adobe Creative Cloud” without the logos, may also be used.
