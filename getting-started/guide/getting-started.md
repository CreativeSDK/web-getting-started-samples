# Getting started with the Creative SDK for Web

The Creative SDK lets you build applications that integrate with the Adobe Creative Cloud and leverage its power to benefit your users. 

From letting your users import from and save to their Creative Cloud storage, to using innovative creative tools via your application, the Creative SDK will help you expand the features of your app by using the Adobe platform.

This guide shows you how to get up and running with the Creative SDK for Web, including how to authenticate your client, a necessary step for integration with the SDK.

## GitHub

You can find companion GitHub repos for the Creative SDK developer guides [on the Creative SDK GitHub organization](https://github.com/CreativeSDK/web-getting-started-samples). 

Be sure to follow all instructions in the `readme`.


<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

1. Before you can work with the Creative SDK, you must register your application and get Client ID and Client Secret values. For details, see [Registering Your Application](#register).
1. The following software is required:

    - **Supported browsers**: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, IE11+
	- **SSL required**: Your site must support SSL on any page that integrates the Creative SDK.


<a name="register"></a>
## Registering Your Application

When you register your application, you are automatically approved for Development Mode. 

- _Your Client ID must be [approved for **Production Mode** by Adobe](https://creativesdk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204601215-How-to-complete-the-Production-Client-ID-Request) before you release your app. See the [What's Next?](#whats-next) section for details on submitting your app for Production Mode approval._

To register your application for Development Mode, follow these steps:

1. Sign in or register for a Creative SDK developer account
1. Go to the [**My Apps** page](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/myapps.html)
1. Click "+ NEW APPLICATION"
1. Fill out the form, then click "ADD APPLICATION"

_**Important:** As part of registering your application, you are given a Client ID and Secret. You will use these in the following steps._


<a name="new-project"></a>
## Adding the SDK to a New Project

The Creative SDK for web doesnâ€™t require that you download any special files or libraries. Instead, you simply include a bit of JavaScript in your web site that loads the necessary resources. 

The JavaScript creates an `AdobeCreativeSDK` object that you can use to access all of the functionality within the CreativeSDK.

The developer guide for each component will explain any setup steps required.


<a name="client-auth"></a>
## Integrating Client Auth

Client authentication is required to use the Creative SDK in order to indentify your site to Adobe. 

You can authenticate your client with the Client ID you have obtained from the [**My Apps** page](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/myapps.html).

### Code

See comments **#1-4** in the code below:

```
<body>

	<!-- 1) Add the Creative SDK script -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn-creativesdk.adobe.io/0.3/csdk.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        // 2) Initialize the AdobeCreativeSDK object
        AdobeCreativeSDK.init({
        	// 3) Add your Client ID
            clientID: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>',
            onError: function(error) {
                // 4) Handle any global or config errors
                if (error.type === AdobeCreativeSDK.ErrorTypes.AUTHENTICATION) { 
                    /* 
                    	Note: this error will occur when you try and 
                    	launch a component without checking if 
                    	the user has authorized your app. 
                    	
                    	From here, you can trigger AdobeCreativeSDK.loginWithRedirect().
                    */
                    console.log('You must be logged in to use the Creative SDK');
                } else if (error.type === AdobeCreativeSDK.ErrorTypes.GLOBAL_CONFIGURATION) { 
                    console.log('Please check your configuration');
                } else if (error.type === AdobeCreativeSDK.ErrorTypes.SERVER_ERROR) { 
                    console.log('Oops, something went wrong');
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

At this point, try reloading your web page to verify if Client Auth has been set up correctly.

### Success

You will know the setup is correct by opening your web console and verifying that you have access to the `AdobeCreativeSDK` object.

### Error

If you get an `XMLHttpRequest` error due to `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'`, there is likely an issue with your SSL setup.
